	abstract = {Background—Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) provides a means for nondestructive characterization of myocardial architecture. We used DT-MRI to investigate changes in direction-dependent water diffusivity to reflect alterations in tissue integrity (trace apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), as well as indicators of remodeling of fiber helix angles, in patients after myocardial infarction.
Methods and Results—Thirty-seven patients (35 men, 2 women; median age, 59) after acute myocardial infarction (median interval from onset, 26 days) were enrolled. DT-MRI was performed at the midventricular level to measure trace ADC, FA, and helix angles of myofibers. Helix angles were grouped into left-handed helical fibers, circumferential fibers, and right-handed helical fibers. Measurements were correlated with viability and regional wall motion assessed by contrast-delay-enhancement and cine MRI, respectively. The infarct zone showed significantly increased trace ADC and decreased FA than the remote zone. The percentage of left-handed helical fibers increased from the remote zone (meanϮSD, 13.3Ϯ5.8\%) to the adjacent zone (19.2Ϯ9.7\%) and infarct zone (25.8Ϯ18.4\%) (MANOVA, Pϭ0.004). The percentage of right-handed helical fibers decreased from the remote zone (35.0Ϯ9.0\%) to the adjacent zone (25.5Ϯ11.5\%) and infarct zone (15.9Ϯ9.2\%) (PϽ0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that the percentage of left-handed helical fibers of the infarct zone was the strongest correlate of infarct size and predictor of ejection fraction.
Conclusions—In vivo DT-MRI of postinfarct myocardium revealed a significant increase in trace ADC and a decrease in FA, indicating altered tissue integrity. The redistribution of fiber architecture correlated with infarct size and left ventricular function. This technique may help us understand structural correlates of functional remodeling after infarction. (Circulation. 2006;114:1036-1045.)},

However, low b-value DWI of the human heart has been considered too challenging because of additional signal loss due to physiological motion, which reduces both signal intensity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We address these signal loss concerns by analyzing cardiac motion during a heartbeat to determine the time-window during which cardiac bulk motion is minimal. Using this information to optimize the acquisition of DWI data and combining it with a dedicated image processing approach has enabled us to develop a novel low b-value diffusion-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance imaging approach, which significantly reduces intravoxel incoherent motion measurement bias introduced by motion.},

Methods: A real-time slice-following technique during free-breathing was combined with a sliding acquisition-window strategy prior Principal Component Analysis temporal Maximum Intensity Projection (PCAtMIP) postprocessing of in-plane co-registered diffusion-weighted images. This methodology was applied to 10 volunteers to quantify the performance of the motion correction technique and the reproducibility of diffusion parameters. Results: The slice-following technique offers a powerful head–foot respiratory motion management solution for SE-EPI cDWI with the advantage of a 100\% duty cycle scanning efficiency. The level of co-registration was further improved using nonrigid motion corrections and was evaluated with a co-registration index. Vascular fraction f and the diffusion coefficients D and D* were determined to be 0.122 ± 0.013, 1.41 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s and 43.6 ± 9.2 × 10−3 mm2/s, respectively. From the multidirectional dataset, the measured mean diffusivity was 1.72 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s and the fractional anisotropy was 0.36 ± 0.02. Conclusion: The slice-following DWI SE-EPI sequence is a promising solution for clinical implementation, offering a robust improved workflow for further evaluation of DWI in cardiology.

Theory and Methods Diffusion-prepared sequences have the flexibility to diffusion encode with a multi-shot image readout. The diffusion preparation was optimized to reduce sensitivity to cardiac bulk motion with second order motion compensation (M1M2). The image readout consisted of a three-dimensional (3D) centric-encoded segmented bSSFP acquisition that incorporated a prospective navigator. Ten healthy subjects were scanned twice using the proposed technique diffusion preparation with and without M1M2 using three orthogonal directions under varying off-resonance conditions.

Results M1M2 diffusion-prepared scans resulted in LV trADC values of 1.5 ± 0.4 × 10−3 mm2/s that were reproducible yielding no statistical differences (P = 0.54). M1M2 diffusion-prepared images showed no ghosting artifacts and/or signal fallout. The non–motion-compensated diffusion-prepared scans yielded LV trADC values of 6.6 ± 0.9 × 10−3 mm2/s and diffusion-prepared images with severe bulk motion-induced artifacts.

	abstract = {Purpose
To quantify the precision of in vivo cardiac DTI (cDTI) acquired with a spin echo, first- and second-order motion-compensated (M1M2), convex optimized diffusion encoding (CODE) sequence.

Methods
Free-breathing CODE-M1M2 cDTI were acquired in healthy volunteers (N = 10) at midsystole and diastole with 10 repeated acquisitions per phase. 95\% confidence intervals of uncertainty in reconstructed diffusion tensor eigenvectors (E⃗1, E⃗2, E⃗3), mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and tensor Mode were measured using a bootstrapping approach. Trends in observed tensor metric uncertainty were evaluated as a function of scan duration, image SNR, cardiac phase, and bulk motion artifacts.

Results
For midsystolic scans including 5 signal averages (scan time: {\textasciitilde}5min), the median myocardial 95\% confidence intervals of uncertainties were: E⃗1: 15.5 ± 1.2°, E⃗2: 31.2 ± 3.5°, E⃗3: 21.8 ± 3.1°, MD: 0.38 ± 0.02 × 10−3mm2/s, FA: 0.20 ± 0.01, and Mode: 1.10 ± 0.08. Uncertainty in all parameters increased for diastolic scans: E⃗1: 31.9 ± 7.1°, E⃗2: 59.6 ± 6.8°, E⃗3: 40.5 ± 6.4°, MD: 0.52 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s, FA: 0.23 ± 0.01, and Mode: 1.57 ± 0.11. Diastolic cDTI also reported higher MD (MDDIA = 1.91 ± 0.34 × 10−3 mm2/s vs. MDSYS = 1.58 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 8 × 10−3) and lower FA values (FADIA = 0.32 ± 0.06 vs. FASYS = 0.37 ± 0.03, P = 0.03).

Conclusion
cDTI precision improved with increasing nondiffusion-weighted (b = 0) image SNR, but gains were minimal for SNR ≥ 25 ({\textasciitilde}10 averages). cDTI precision was also sensitive to intershot bulk motion artifacts, which led to better precision for midsystolic imaging.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI), but, unlike other diffusion MRI applications, there has been little investigation of the effects of noise on the parameters typically derived. One method of mitigating noise floor effects when there are multiple image averages, as in cDTI, is to average the complex rather than the magnitude data, but the phase contains contributions from bulk motion, which must be removed first. The effects of noise on the mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), helical angle (HA) and absolute secondary eigenvector angle (E2A) were simulated with various diffusion weightings (b values). The effect of averaging complex versus magnitude images was investigated. In vivo cDTI was performed in 10 healthy subjects with b = 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 s/mm2. A technique for removing the motion-induced component of the image phase present in vivo was implemented by subtracting a low-resolution copy of the phase from the original images before averaging the complex images. MD, FA, E2A and the transmural gradient in HA were compared for un-averaged, magnitude- and complex-averaged reconstructions. Simulations demonstrated an over-estimation of FA and MD at low b values and an under-estimation at high b values. The transition is relatively signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) independent and occurs at a higher b value for FA (b = 1000–1250 s/mm2) than MD (b ≈ 250 s/mm2). E2A is under-estimated at low and high b values with a transition at b ≈ 1000 s/mm2, whereas the bias in HA is comparatively small. The under-estimation of FA and MD at high b values is caused by noise floor effects, which can be mitigated by averaging the complex data. Understanding the parameters of interest and the effects of noise informs the selection of the optimal b values. When complex data are available, they should be used to maximise the benefit from the acquisition of multiple averages. The combination of complex data is also a valuable step towards segmented acquisitions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: In vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) is uniquely capable of interrogating laminar myocardial dynamics non-invasively. A comprehensive dataset of quantative parameters and comparison with subject anthropometrics is required.
Methods: cDTI was performed at 3T with a diffusion weighted STEAM sequence. Data was acquired from the mid left ventricle in 43 subjects during the systolic and diastolic pauses. Global and regional values were determined for fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), helix angle gradient (HAg, degrees/\%depth) and the secondary eigenvector angulation (E2A). Regression analysis was performed between global values and subject anthropometrics.
Results: All cDTI parameters displayed regional heterogeneity. The RR interval had a significant, but clinically small effect on systolic values for FA, HAg and E2A. Male sex and increasing left ventricular end diastolic volume were associated with increased systolic HAg. Diastolic HAg and systolic E2A were both directly related to left ventricular mass and body surface area. There was an inverse relationship between E2A mobility and both age and ejection fraction.
Conclusions: Future interpretations of quantitative cDTI data should take into account anthropometric variations observed with patient age, body surface area and left ventricular measurements. Further work determining the impact of technical factors such as strain and SNR is required.},

The aim of this study was to validate a stimulated-echo diffusion sequence using phantoms, and to assess the intercentre reproducibility of in-vivo diffusion measures using the sequence.
Methods and results: A stimulated-echo, cardiac-gated DT-CMR sequence with a reduced-field-of-view, single-shot EPI readout was used at two centres with 3 T MRI scanners. Four alkane phantoms with known diffusivities were scanned at a single centre using a stimulated echo sequence and a spin-echo Stejskal-Tanner diffusion sequence. The median (maximum, minimum) difference between the DT-CMR sequence and Stejskal-Tanner sequence was 0.01 (0.04, 0.0006) × 10−3 mm2/s (2\%), and between the DT-CMR sequence and literature diffusivities was 0.02 (0.05, 0.006) × 10−3 mm2/s (4\%). The same ten healthy volunteers were scanned using the DT-CMR sequence at the two centres less than seven days apart. Average ADC and FA were calculated in a single mid-ventricular, short axis slice. Intercentre differences were tested for statistical significance at the p {\textless} 0.05 level using paired t-tests. The mean ADC ± standard deviation for all subjects averaged over both centres was 1.10 ± 0.06 × 10−3 mm2/s in systole and 1.20 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s in diastole; FA was 0.41 ± 0.04 in systole and 0.54 ± 0.03 in diastole. With similarly-drawn regions-of-interest, systolic ADC (difference 0.05 × 10−3 mm2/s), systolic FA (difference 0.003) and diastolic FA (difference 0.01) were not statistically significantly different between centres (p {\textgreater} 0.05), and only the diastolic ADC showed a statistically significant, but numerically small, difference of 0.07 × 10−3 mm2/s (p = 0.047). The intercentre, intrasubject coefficients of variance were: systolic ADC 7\%, FA 6\%; diastolic ADC 7\%, FA 3\%.
Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the accuracy of a stimulated-echo DT-CMR sequence in phantoms, and demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reproducible ADC and FA in healthy volunteers at separate centres with well-matched sequences and processing.},

	abstract = {Background: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) measures the magnitudes and directions of intramyocardial water diffusion. Assuming the cross-myocyte components to be constrained by the laminar microstructures of myocardium, we hypothesized that cDTI at two cardiac phases might identify any abnormalities of laminar orientation and mobility in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
Methods: We performed cDTI in vivo at 3 Tesla at end-systole and late diastole in 11 healthy controls and 11 patients with HCM, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) for detection of regional fibrosis.
Results: Voxel-wise analysis of diffusion tensors relative to left ventricular coordinates showed expected transmural changes of myocardial helix-angle, with no significant differences between phases or between HCM and control groups. In controls, the angle of the second eigenvector of diffusion (E2A) relative to the local wall tangent plane was larger in systole than diastole, in accord with previously reported changes of laminar orientation. HCM hearts showed higher than normal global E2A in systole (63.9° vs 56.4° controls, p = 0.026) and markedly raised E2A in diastole (46.8° vs 24.0° controls, p {\textless} 0.001). In hypertrophic regions, E2A retained a high, systole-like angulation even in diastole, independent of LGE, while regions of normal wall thickness did not (LGE present 57.8°, p = 0.0028, LGE absent 54.8°, p = 0.0022 vs normal thickness 38.1°).
Conclusions: In healthy controls, the angles of cross-myocyte components of diffusion were consistent with previously reported transmural orientations of laminar microstructures and their changes with contraction. In HCM, especially in hypertrophic regions, they were consistent with hypercontraction in systole and failure of relaxation in diastole. Further investigation of this finding is required as previously postulated effects of strain might be a confounding factor.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to implement a quantitative in vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique that was robust, reproducible, and feasible to perform in patients with cardiovascular disease. A stimulated-echo single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with zonal excitation and parallel imaging was implemented, together with a novel modification of the prospective navigator (NAV) technique combined with a biofeedback mechanism. Ten volunteers were scanned on two different days, each time with both multiple breath-hold (MBH) and NAV multislice protocols. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and helix angle (HA) fiber maps were created. Comparison of initial and repeat scans showed good reproducibility for both MBH and NAV techniques for FA (P {\textgreater} 0.22), MD (P {\textgreater} 0.15), and HA (P {\textgreater} 0.28). Comparison of MBH and NAV FA (FAMBHday1 = 0.60 ± 0.04, FANAVday1 = 0.60 ± 0.03, P = 0.57) and MD (MDMBHday1 = 0.8 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s, MDNAVday1 = 0.9 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.07) values showed no significant differences, while HA values (HAMBHday1Endo = 22 ± 10°, HAMBHday1Mid-Endo = 20 ± 6°, HAMBHday1Mid-Epi = −1 ± 6°, HAMBHday1Epi = −17 ± 6°, HANAVday1Endo = 7 ± 7°, HANAVday1Mid-Endo = 13 ± 8°, HANAVday1Mid-Epi = −2 ± 7°, HANAVday1Epi = −14 ± 6°) were significantly different. The scan duration was 20\% longer with the NAV approach. Currently, the MBH approach is the more robust in normal volunteers. While the NAV technique still requires resolution of some bulk motion sensitivity issues, these preliminary experiments show its potential for in vivo clinical cardiac diffusion tensor imaging and for delivering high-resolution in vivo 3D DTI tractography of the heart.

	abstract = {Purpose To compare signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency and diffusion tensor metrics of cardiac diffusion tensor mapping using acceleration-compensated spin-echo (SE) and stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) imaging. Methods Diffusion weighted SE and STEAM sequences were implemented on a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR system. The SNR efficiency of SE and STEAM was measured (b = 50–450 s/mm2) in isotropic agar, anisotropic diffusion phantoms and the in vivo human heart. Diffusion tensor analysis was performed on mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, helix and transverse angles. Results In the isotropic phantom, the ratio of SNR efficiency for SE versus STEAM, SNRt(SE/STEAM), was 2.84 ± 0.08 for all tested b-values. In the anisotropic diffusion phantom the ratio decreased from 2.75 ± 0.05 to 2.20 ± 0.13 with increasing b-value, similar to the in vivo decrease from 2.91 ± 0.43 to 2.30 ± 0.30. Diffusion tensor analysis revealed reduced deviation of helix angles from a linear transmural model and reduced transverse angle standard deviation for SE compared with STEAM. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were measured to be statistically different (P {\textless} 0.001) between SE and STEAM. Conclusion Cardiac DTI using motion-compensated SE yields a 2.3–2.9× increase in SNR efficiency relative to STEAM and improved accuracy of tensor metrics. The SE method hence presents an attractive alternative to STEAM based approaches. Magn Reson Med 76:862–872, 2016. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose Myocardial microstructure has been challenging to probe in vivo. Spin echo–based diffusion-weighted sequences allow for single-shot acquisitions but are highly sensitive to cardiac motion. In this study, the use of second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding was compared with first-order motion-compensated diffusion-weighted imaging during systolic contraction of the heart. Methods First- and second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding gradients were incorporated into a triggered single-shot spin echo sequence. The effect of contractile motion on the apparent diffusion coefficients and tensor orientations was investigated in vivo from basal to apical level of the heart. Results Second-order motion compensation was found to increase the range of systolic trigger delays from 30\%–55\% to 15\%–77\% peak systole at the apex and from 25\%–50\% to 15\%–79\% peak systole at the base. Diffusion tensor analysis yielded more physiological transmural distributions when using second-order motion-compensated diffusion tensor imaging. Conclusion Higher-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding decreases the sensitivity to cardiac motion, thereby enabling cardiac DTI over a wider range of time points during systolic contraction of the heart.

Methods Diffusion-encoding gradient waveforms were designed for a range of b-values and spatial resolutions with and without motion compensation using the CODE framework. CODE, first moment (M1) nulled CODE-M1, and first and second moment (M2) nulled CODE-M1M2 were used to acquire neuro, liver, and cardiac ADC maps in healthy subjects (n=10) that were compared respectively to monopolar (MONO), BIPOLAR (M1 = 0), and motion-compensated (MOCO, M1 + M2 = 0) diffusion encoding. Results CODE significantly improved the SNR of neuro ADC maps compared with MONO (19.5 ± 2.5 versus 14.5 ± 1.9). CODE-M1 liver ADCs were significantly lower (1.3 ± 0.1 versus 1.8 ± 0.3 × 10−3 mm2/s, ie, less motion corrupted) and more spatially uniform (6\% versus 55\% ROI difference) than MONO and had higher SNR than BIPOLAR (SNR = 14.9 ± 5.3 versus 8.0 ± 3.1). CODE-M1M2 cardiac ADCs were significantly lower than MONO (1.9 ± 0.6 versus 3.8 ± 0.3 x10−3 mm2/s) throughout the cardiac cycle and had higher SNR than MOCO at systole (9.1 ± 3.9 versus 7.0 ± 2.6) while reporting similar ADCs (1.5 ± 0.2 versus 1.4 ± 0.6 × 10−3 mm2/s). Conclusions CODE significantly improved SNR for ADC mapping in the brain, liver and heart, and significantly improved DWI bulk motion robustness in the liver and heart.

	abstract = {We present a method for diffusion tensor MRI in the beating heart that is insensitive to cardiac motion and strain. Using a stimulated echo pulse sequence with two electrocardiogram (ECG) triggers, diffusion-encoding bipolar gradient pulses are applied at identical phases in consecutive cardiac cycles. In this experiment, diffusion is encoded at a single phase in the cardiac cycle of less than 30 ms in duration. This encoding produces no phase shifts for periodic motion and is independent of intervening strains. Studies in a gel phantom with cyclic deformation confirm that by using this sequence we can map the diffusion tensor free of effects of cyclic motion. In normal human subjects, myocardial diffusion eigenvalues measured with the present method showed no significant change between acquisitions encoded at maximum contractile velocity (peak) vs. at myocardial standstill (end-systole), demonstrating motion independence of in vivo diffusion measurements. Diffusion tensor images acquired with the present method agree with registered data acquired with a previous cardiac diffusion MRI method that was shown to be valid in the normal heart, strongly supporting the validity of MRI diffusion measurement in the beating heart. Myocardial sheet and fiber dynamics measured during systole showed that normal human myocardial sheet orientations tilt toward the radial during systole, and fiber orientations tilt toward the longitudinal, in qualitative agreement with previous invasive studies in canines. These results demonstrate the technique's ability to measure myocardial diffusion accurately at any point in the cardiac cycle free of measurable motion effect, as if the heart were frozen at the point of acquisition.

	abstract = {Background: Despite the established role of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in characterizing chronic myocardial infarction (MI), a significant portion of chronic MI patients are contraindicative for the use of contrast agents. One promising alternative contrast free technique is diffusion weighted CMR (dwCMR), which has been shown ex vivo to be sensitive to myocardial fibrosis. We used a recently developed in vivo dwCMR in chronic MI pigs to compare apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with LGE imaging for infarct characterization.
Methods: In eleven mini pigs, chronic MI was induced by complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 150 minutes. LGE, cine, and dwCMR imaging was performed 8 weeks post MI. ADC maps were derived from three orthogonal diffusion directions (b = 400 s/mm2) and one non-diffusion weighted image. Two semi-automatic infarct classification methods, threshold and full width half max (FWHM), were performed in both LGE and ADC maps. Regional wall motion (RWM) analysis was performed and compared to ADC maps to determine if any observed ADC change was significantly influenced by bulk motion.
Results: ADC of chronic MI territories was significantly increased (threshold: 2.4 ± 0.3 μm2/ms, FWHM: 2.4 ± 0.2 μm2/ms) compared to remote myocardium (1.4 ± 0.3 μm2/ms). RWM was significantly reduced (threshold: 1.0 ± 0.4 mm, FWHM: 0.9 ± 0.4 mm) in infarcted regions delineated by ADC compared to remote myocardium (8.3 ± 0.1 mm). ADC-derived infarct volume and location had excellent agreement with LGE. Both LGE and ADC were in complete agreement when identifying transmural infarcts. Additionally, ADC was able to detect LGE-delineated infarcted segments with high sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. (threshold: 0.88, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.94, FWHM: 0.98, 0.97, 0.93, and 0.99, respectively).
Conclusions: In vivo diffusion weighted CMR has potential as a contrast free alternative for LGE in characterizing chronic MI.},

	abstract = {Backgrounds: Previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DW-CMR) is highly sensitive to replacement fibrosis of chronic myocardial infarction. Despite this sensitivity to myocardial infarction, DW-CMR has not been established as a method to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis. We propose the application of a recently developed DW-CMR technique to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients and compare its performance with established CMR techniques.
Methods: HCM patients (N = 23) were recruited and scanned with the following protocol: standard morphological localizers, DW-CMR, extracellular volume (ECV) CMR, and late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) imaging for reference. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and ECV maps were segmented into 6 American Heart Association (AHA) segments. Positive regions for myocardial fibrosis were defined as: ADC {\textgreater} 2.0 μm2/ms and ECV {\textgreater} 30 \%. Fibrotic and non-fibrotic mean ADC and ECV values were compared as well as ADC-derived and ECV-derived fibrosis burden. In addition, fibrosis regional detection was compared between ADC and ECV calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) using ECV as the gold-standard reference.
Results: ADC (2.4 ± 0.2 μm2/ms) of fibrotic regions (ADC {\textgreater} 2.0 μm2/ms) was significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) higher than ADC (1.5 ± 0.2 μm2/ms) of non-fibrotic regions. Similarly, ECV (35 ± 4 \%) of fibrotic regions (ECV {\textgreater} 30 \%) was significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) higher than ECV (26 ± 2 \%) of non-fibrotic regions. In fibrotic regions defined by ECV, ADC (2.2 ± 0.3 μm2/ms) was again significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher than ADC (1.6 ± 0.3 μm2/ms) of non-fibrotic regions. In fibrotic regions defined by ADC criterion, ECV (34 ± 5 \%) was significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) higher than ECV (28 ± 3 \%) in non-fibrotic regions. ADC-derived and ECV-derived fibrosis burdens were in substantial agreement (intra-class correlation = 0.83). Regional detection between ADC and ECV of diffuse fibrosis yielded substantial agreement (κ = 0.66) with high sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy (0.80, 0.85, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively).
Conclusion: DW-CMR is sensitive to diffuse myocardial fibrosis and is capable of characterizing the extent of fibrosis in HCM patients.},

Methods Healthy pigs (n = 11) were successfully scanned with a 3D cine displacement-encoded imaging with stimulated echoes and a monopolar-stimulated echo-planar imaging diffusion tensor imaging sequence at 3 T during diastasis, peak systole, and strain sweet spots in a midventricular short-axis slice. The same diffusion tensor imaging sequence was repeated ex vivo after arresting the hearts in either a relaxed (KCl-induced) or contracted (BaCl2-induced) state. The displacement-encoded imaging with stimulated echoes data were used to strain-correct the in vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging in diastole and systole. The orientation of the primary (helix angles) and secondary (E2A) diffusion eigenvectors was compared with and without strain correction and to the strain-free ex vivo data. Results Strain correction reduces systolic E2A significantly when compared without strain correction and ex vivo (median absolute E2A = 34.3° versus E2A = 57.1° (P = 0.01), E2A = 60.5° (P = 0.006), respectively). The systolic distribution of E2A without strain correction is closer to the contracted ex vivo distribution than with strain correction, root mean square deviation of 0.027 versus 0.038. Conclusions The current strain-correction model amplifies the contribution of microscopic strain to diffusion resulting in an overcorrection of E2A.

	abstract = {Purpose To examine the relationship between myofiber disarray and myocardial hypokinesis in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using noninvasive cardiac diffusion and strain MRI. Materials and Methods Five patients with a diagnosis of HCM and five age-matched healthy volunteers were studied and compared. Cardiac diffusion MRI was applied to map in vivo myocardial fiber architecture. Cardiac strain MRI was applied to map myocardial motion. By acquiring registered diffusion and strain MRI images in vivo on both normal and HCM hearts, we investigated in HCM the relationship between myofiber disarray and systolic strain components, including radial, fiber, and cross-fiber strains, and sought to determine the mechanism behind disarray-related myocardial dysfunction in HCM. Results Regionally disordered fiber orientation and reduced diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) were found in HCM, demonstrating myofiber disarray. Intramural myocardial strain hypokinesis (reduced radial, fiber, and cross-fiber strains) was also observed in HCM in the same region, and was found to be correlated with FA. The correlation between FA and hypokinesis was found to be stronger in the cross-fiber direction (part of the passive myocardial function) compared to the fiber direction (part of the active myocardial function). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the principal feature of HCM is the reduction of myocardium passive compliance. The angle between principal shortening and fiber orientation was markedly disordered in HCM, indicating an abnormal transmural coupling. Conclusion Myofiber disarray in HCM is correlated with abnormalities of both passive and active myocardial function, and the normal patterns of fiber shortening and wall thickening are deranged in HCM.

	abstract = {Cardiac diffusion MRI based on stimulated-echo acquisition mode (STEAM) techniques is hampered by its inherent low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. Diffusion imaging using standard spin-echo (SE) techniques, on the other hand, offers higher SNRs but has been considered impractical for the beating heart due to excessive signal attenuation from cardiac bulk motion. In this work the effect of systolic cardiac motion on different diffusion-encoding schemes was studied in detail. Numerical simulations based on in vivo motion data (acquired by MRI tagging techniques) demonstrate an up to 10-fold decrease in bulk motion sensitivity of the diffusion encoding if the first-order moment of the diffusion-encoding gradients is nullified. It is shown that the remaining systolic phase pattern on the myocardium does not influence the magnitude images if the spatial resolution is chosen to be higher than 4 mm. Given these relatively low resolution requirements, we obtained in vivo diffusion-weighted (DW) short-axis images from four healthy volunteers using an SE-based diffusion-encoding sequence with excitation and refocusing in orthogonal planes for field of view (FOV) reduction. The results showed no significant signal loss due to cardiac motion, and the direction of the principal eigenvalues was found to be in good agreement with known myocardial fiber orientation.

	abstract = {Background: In-vivo cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows imaging of alterations of cardiac fiber architecture in diseased hearts. Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) causes myocardial infiltration of misfolded proteins with unknown consequences for myocardial microstructure. This study applied CMR DTI in CA to assess microstructural alterations and their consequences for myocardial function compared to healthy controls.
Methods: Ten patients with CA (8 AL, 2 ATTR) and ten healthy controls were studied using a diffusion-weighed second-order motion-compensated spin-echo sequence at 1.5 T. Additionally, left ventricular morphology, ejection fraction, strain and native T1 values were obtained in all subjects. In CA patients, T1 mapping was repeated after the administration of gadolinium for extracellular volume fraction (ECV) calculation. CMR DTI analysis was performed to yield the scalar diffusion metrics mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as the characteristics of myofiber orientation including helix, transverse and E2A sheet angle (HA, TA, E2A).
Results: MD and FA were found to be significantly different between CA patients and healthy controls (MD 1.77 ± 0.17 10− 3 vs 1.41 ± 0.07 10− 3 mm2/s, p {\textless} 0.001; FA 0.25 ± 0.04 vs 0.35 ± 0.03, p {\textless} 0.001). MD demonstrated an excellent correlation with native T1 (r = 0.908, p {\textless} 0.001) while FA showed a significant correlation with ECV in the CA population (r = − 0.851, p {\textless} 0.002). HA exhibited a more circumferential orientation of myofibers in CA patients, in conjunction with a higher TA standard deviation and a higher absolute E2A sheet angle. The transmural HA slope was found to be strongly correlated with the global longitudinal strain (r = 0.921, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: CMR DTI reveals significant alterations of scalar diffusion metrics in CA patients versus healthy controls. Elevated MD and lower FA values indicate myocardial disarray with higher diffusion in CA that correlates well with native T1 and ECV measures. In CA patients, CMR DTI showed pronounced circumferential orientation of the myofibers, which may provide the rationale for the reduction of global longitudinal strain that occurs in amyloidosis patients. Accordingly, CMR DTI captures specific features of amyloid infiltration, which provides a deeper understanding of the microstructural consequences of CA.},

	abstract = {Purpose Diffusion tensor cardiovascular MR (DT-CMR) using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) with echo-planar-imaging (EPI) readouts is a low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) technique and therefore typically has a low spatial resolution. Spiral trajectories are more efficient than EPI, and could increase the SNR. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of a novel STEAM spiral DT-CMR sequence with an equivalent established EPI technique. Methods A STEAM DT-CMR sequence was implemented with a spiral readout and a reduced field of view. An in vivo comparison of DT-CMR parameters and data quality between EPI and spiral was performed in 11 healthy volunteers imaged in peak systole and diastasis at 3 T. The SNR was compared in a phantom and in vivo. Results There was a greater than 49\% increase in the SNR in vivo and in the phantom measurements (in vivo septum, systole: SNREPI = 8.0 ± 2.2, SNRspiral = 12.0 ± 2.7; diastasis: SNREPI = 8.1 ± 1.6, SNRspiral = 12.0 ± 3.7). There were no significant differences in helix angle gradient (HAG) (systole: HAGEPI = −0.79 ± 0.07 °/\%; HAGspiral = −0.74 ± 0.16 °/\%; P = 0.11; diastasis: HAGEPI = −0.63 ± 0.05 °/\%; HAGspiral = −0.56 ± 0.14 °/\%; P = 0.20), mean diffusivity (MD) in systole (MDEPI = 0.99 ± 0.06 × 10−3 mm2/s, MDspiral = 1.00 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.23) and secondary eigenvector angulation (E2A) (systole: E2AEPI = 61 ± 10 °; E2Aspiral = 63 ± 10 °; P = 0.77; diastasis: E2AEPI = 18 ± 11 °; E2Aspiral = 15 ± 8 °; P = 0.20) between the sequences. There was a small difference (≈ 20\%) in fractional anisotropy (FA) (systole: FAEPI = 0.49 ± 0.03, FAspiral = 0.41 ± 0.04; P {\textless} 0.01; diastasis: FAEPI = 0.66 ± 0.05, FAspiral = 0.55 ± 0.03; P {\textless} 0.01) and mean diffusivity in diastasis (10\%; MDEPI = 1.00 ± 0.12 × 10−3 mm2/s, MDspiral = 1.10 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.02). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate DT-CMR STEAM using a spiral trajectory. The SNR was increased by using a spiral rather than the more established EPI readout, and the DT-CMR parameters were largely similar between the two sequences.

	abstract = {Background: Stimulated-echo (STEAM) and, more recently, motion-compensated spin-echo (M2-SE) techniques have been used for in-vivo diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) assessment of cardiac microstructure. The two techniques differ in the length scales of diffusion interrogated, their signal-to-noise ratio efficiency and sensitivity to both motion and strain. Previous comparisons of the techniques have used high performance gradients at 1.5 T in a single cardiac phase. However, recent work using STEAM has demonstrated novel findings of microscopic dysfunction in cardiomyopathy patients, when DT-CMR was performed at multiple cardiac phases. We compare STEAM and M2-SE using a clinical 3 T scanner in three potentially clinically interesting cardiac phases.
Methods: Breath hold mid-ventricular short-axis DT-CMR was performed in 15 subjects using M2-SE and STEAM at endsystole, systolic sweet-spot and diastasis. Success was defined by ≥50\% of the myocardium demonstrating normal helix angles. From successful acquisitions DT-CMR results relating to tensor orientation, size and shape were compared between sequences and cardiac phases using non-parametric statistics. Strain information was obtained using cine spiral displacement encoding with stimulated echoes for comparison with DT-CMR results.
Results: Acquisitions were successful in 98\% of STEAM and 76\% of M2-SE cases and visual helix angle (HA) map scores were higher for STEAM at the sweet-spot and diastasis. There were significant differences between sequences (p {\textless} 0.05) in mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), tensor mode, transmural HA gradient and absolute second eigenvector angle (E2A). Differences in E2A between systole and diastole correlated with peak radial strain for both sequences (p ≤ 0.01).
Conclusion: M2-SE and STEAM can be performed equally well at peak systole at 3 T using standard gradients, but at the sweet-spot and diastole STEAM is more reliable and image quality scores are higher. Differences in DT-CMR results are potentially due to differences in motion sensitivity and the longer diffusion time of STEAM, although the latter appears to be the dominant factor. The benefits of both sequences should be considered when planning future studies and sequence and cardiac phase specific normal ranges should be used for comparison.},

	abstract = {Background: Myocardial disarray is an important histological feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which has been studied post-mortem, but its in-vivo prevalence and extent is unknown. Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging (cDTI) provides information on mean intravoxel myocyte orientation and potentially myocardial disarray. Recent technical advances have improved in-vivo cDTI, and the aim of this study was to assess the interstudy reproducibility of quantitative in-vivo cDTI in patients with HCM.
Methods and results: A stimulated-echo single-shot-EPI sequence with zonal excitation and parallel imaging was implemented. Ten patients with HCM were each scanned on 2 different days. For each scan 3 short axis mid-ventricular slices were acquired with cDTI at end systole. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and helix angle (HA) maps were created using a cDTI post-processing platform developed in-house. The mean ± SD global FA was 0.613 ± 0.044, MD was 0.750 ± 0.154 × 10-3 mm2/s and HA was epicardium −34.3 ± 7.6°, mesocardium 3.5 ± 6.9° and endocardium 38.9 ± 8.1°. Comparison of initial and repeat studies showed global interstudy reproducibility for FA (SD = ± 0.045, Coefficient of Variation (CoV) = 7.2\%), MD (SD = ± 0.135 × 10-3 mm2/s, CoV = 18.6\%) and HA (epicardium SD = ± 4.8°; mesocardium SD = ± 3.4°; endocardium SD = ± 2.9°). Reproducibility of FA was superior to MD (p = 0.003). Global MD was significantly higher in the septum than the reference lateral wall (0.784 ± 0.188 vs 0.750 ± 0.154 x10-3 mm2/s, p {\textless} 0.001). Septal HA was significantly lower than the reference lateral wall in all 3 transmural layers (from −8.3° to −10.4°, all p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the interstudy reproducibility of DTI in the human HCM heart in-vivo and the largest cDTI study in HCM to date. Our results show good reproducibility of FA, MD and HA which indicates that current technology yields robust in-vivo measurements that have potential clinical value. The interpretation of regional differences in the septum requires further investigation.},

Methods Ten subjects were scanned using stimulated echo acquisition mode echo planar imaging with six b-values, from 50 to 950 s·mm−2, plus b = 15 s·mm−2 reference. The relationship between b-value and both signal loss and signal-to-noise ratio measures was investigated. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and helical angle maps were calculated using all possible b-value pairs to investigate the effects of diffusion weighting on the main and reference data. Results Signal decay at low b-values was dominated by processes with high apparent diffusion coefficients, most likely microvascular perfusion. This effect could be avoided by diffusion weighting of the reference images. Parameter maps were improved with increased b-value until the diffusion-weighted signal approached the noise floor. For the protocol used in this study, b = 750 s·mm−2 combined with 150 s·mm−2 diffusion weighting of the reference images proved optimal. Conclusion Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and helical angle from cDTI are influenced by the b-value of the main and reference data. Using optimal values improves parameter maps and avoids microvascular perfusion effects. This optimized protocol should provide greater sensitivity to pathological changes in parameter maps.

Despite applying motion-compensation strategies, residual motion can cause misleading signal attenuation. The purpose of this study is to estimate the motion-induced error in both sequences by analysis of image phase. Methods Diffusion-weighted motion-compensated SE sequences and STEAM imaging was applied in vivo with diffusion encoding along 3 orthogonal directions. A b-value range of 100 to 600 s/mm2 and trigger delays of 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of end systole and middiastole were used. Eddy-current contributions were obtained from phantom measurements. After computation of motion-induced phase maps, the amount of signal dephasing was computed from phase gradients, and the resulting errors in diffusion tensor parameters were calculated. Results Motion-induced dephasing from the STEAM sequence showed less dependency on the b-value and no dependency on the heart phase, whereas SE imaging performed best at 75\% end systole followed by 50\% end systole and middiastole. For a typical experimental setting, errors of 3.3\%/3.0\% mean diffusivity, 4.9\%/4.8\% fractional anisotropy, 2.9º/3.2º helix angulation, 0.8º/0.7º transverse angulation, and 9.9º/10.0º sheet angulation (SE/STEAM) were calculated. Conclusion Image phase contains valuable information regarding uncompensated motion and eddy currents in cardiac DTI. Although the trigger delay window for SE is narrower compared with the STEAM-based approach, imaging in both systole and diastole is feasible and both sequences perform similarly if the trigger delays are selected carefully with SE.},

This work proposes a clinically compatible and robust technique to provide three-dimensional (3-D) fiber architecture properties of the human heart. To this end, 10 short-axis slices were acquired across the entire heart using a multiple shifted trigger delay (TD) strategy under free breathing conditions. Interscan motion was first corrected automatically using a nonrigid registration method. Then, two post-processing schemes were optimized and compared: an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) filtering and temporal maximum intensity projection (TMIP), and an algorithm that uses the wavelet-based image fusion (WIF) method. The two methods were applied to the registered diffusion-weighted (DW) images to cope with intrascan motion-induced signal loss. The tensor fields were finally calculated, from which fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and 3-D fiber tracts were derived and compared. The results show that the comparison of the FA values (FAPCATMIP = 0.45 ±0.10, FAWIF = 0.42 ±0.05, P=0.06) showed no significant difference, while the MD values ( MDPCATMIP=0.83 ±0.12×10-3 mm2/s, MDWIF=0.74±0.05×10-3 mm2/s, P=0.028) were significantly different. Improved helix angle variations through the myocardium wall reflecting the rotation characteristic of cardiac fibers were observed with WIF. This study demonstrates that the combination of multiple shifted TD acquisitions and dedicated post-processing makes it feasible to retrieve in vivo cardiac tractographies from free-breathing DTI acquisitions. The substantial improvements were observed using the WIF method instead of the previously published PCATMIP technique.},

	abstract = {Background:  After acute myocardial infarction (AMI), reperfusion injury is associated with microvascular lesions and myocardial edema.
Purpose:  To evaluate the performance of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) quantification compared with T1 and T2 values in the detection of acute myocardial injury. Materials and Methods:  In this prospective study conducted from June 2016 to November 2018, participants without a history of heart failure or cardiomyopathy were enrolled after undergoing reperfusion for their first AMI. Quantitative T1 and T2 mapping were performed with a 1.5-T MRI scanner and compared with a fast free-breathing acquisition technique for ADC mapping (approximate duration, 3 minutes; five slices; spin-echo cardiac diffusion acquisition; b values, 0 and 200 sec/mm2; six diffusion-encoding directions; five repetitions). Quantitative ADC and unenhanced T1 and T2 values were compared in infarct, border, and remote regions by using Welch analysis of variance with Games-Howell post hoc test for pairwise comparisons.
Results:  Thirty-four participants with AMI underwent MRI an average of 5 days 6 1.9 (standard deviation) after reperfusion. Mean ADC was markedly high in the infarcted regions (2.32 3 1023 mm2/sec; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.28, 2.36) and moderately high in the border regions (1.91 31023 mm2/sec; 95\% CI: 1.89, 1.94; P , .001). In remote regions, mean ADC (1.62 31023 mm2/sec; 95\% CI: 1.59, 1.64) was comparable to that measured in vivo in healthy volunteers. Within the same regions of interest, although the measures showed similar trends in infarct and remote regions for T1 (mean, 1332 mec [95\% CI: 1296, 1368] vs 1045 msec [95\% CI: 1034, 1056]; P , .001) and T2 (72 msec [95\% CI: 69, 75] vs 50 msec [95\% CI: 49, 51]; P , .001), the magnitude of the differences among regions was greater when using ADC. Normalized signal differences between infarct and remote regions showed that diffusion-weighted MRI depicted edema 5.1 (P , .001) and 3.5 (P , .001) times greater than did T1 and T2 maps, respectively.
Conclusion:  Multislice cardiac diffusion-weighted images could be acquired in those with acute myocardial injury. Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient mapping showed greater differences among remote regions and lesions than did T1 or T2 mapping.},

	abstract = {Purpose Cardiomyocyte organization and performance underlie cardiac function, but the in vivo mobility of these cells during contraction and filling remains difficult to probe. Herein, a novel trigger delay (TD) scout sequence was used to acquire high in-plane resolution (1.6 mm) Spin-Echo (SE) cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) at three distinct cardiac phases. The objective was to characterize cardiomyocyte organization and mobility throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods Nine healthy volunteers were imaged with cDTI at three distinct cardiac phases (early systole, late systole, and diastasis). The sequence used a free-breathing Spin-Echo (SE) cDTI protocol (b-values = 350s/mm2, twelve diffusion encoding directions, eight repetitions) to acquire high-resolution images (1.6x1.6x8mm3) at 3T in {\textasciitilde}7 minutes/cardiac phase. Helix Angle (HA), Helix Angle Range (HAR), E2 angle (E2A), Transverse Angle (TA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), diffusion tensor eigenvalues (λ1-2-3), and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in the left ventricle (LV) were characterized.
Results Images from the patient-specific TD scout sequence demonstrated that SE cDTI acquisition was possible at early systole, late systole, and diastasis in 78\%, 100\% and 67\% of the cases, respectively. At the mid-ventricular level, mobility (reported as median [IQR]) was observed in HAR between early systole and late systole (76.9 [72.6, 80.5]˚ vs 96.6 [85.9, 100.3]˚, p{\textless}0.001). E2A also changed significantly between early systole, late systole, and diastasis (27.7 [20.8, 35.1]˚ vs 45.2 [42.1, 49]˚ vs 20.7 [16.6, 26.4]˚, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusion We demonstrate that it is possible to probe cardiomyocyte mobility using multi-phase and high resolution cDTI. In healthy volunteers, aggregate cardiomyocytes re-orient themselves},

In this study, a new, efficient pipeline was proposed to combine microstructural cDTI and functional DENSE data in order to estimate Eff in vivo. Methods Thirty healthy volunteers were scanned with three long-axis (LA) and three short-axis (SA) DENSE slices using 2D displacement encoding and one SA slice of cDTI. The total acquisition time was 11 minutes ± 3 minutes across volunteers. The pipeline first generates 3D SA displacements from all DENSE slices which are then combined with cDTI data to generate a cine of myofiber orientations and compute Eff. The precision of the post-processing pipeline was assessed using a computational phantom study. Transmural myofiber strain was compared to circumferential strain, Ecc, in healthy volunteers using a Wilcoxon sign rank test. Results In vivo, computed Eff was found uniform transmurally compared to Ecc (−0.14[−0.15, −0.12] vs −0.18 [−0.20, −0.16], P {\textless} .001, −0.14 [−0.16, −0.12] vs −0.16 [−0.17, −0.13], P {\textless} .001 and −0.14 [−0.16, −0.12] vs Ecc\_C = −0.14 [−0.15, −0.11], P = .002, Eff\_C vs Ecc\_C in the endo, mid, and epi layers, respectively).

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Aims
              Microvascular dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is predictive of clinical decline, however underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) allows in vivo characterization of myocardial microstructure by quantifying mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion, and secondary eigenvector angle (E2A). In this cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) study, we examine associations between perfusion and cDTI parameters to understand the sequence of pathophysiology and the interrelation between vascular function and underlying microstructure.
            
            
              Methods and results
              Twenty HCM patients underwent 3.0T CMR which included: spin-echo cDTI, adenosine stress and rest perfusion mapping, cine-imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Ten controls underwent cDTI. Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), MD, FA, E2A, and wall thickness were calculated per segment and further divided into subendocardial (inner 50\%) and subepicardial (outer 50\%) regions. Segments with wall thickness ≤11 mm, MPR ≥2.2, and no visual LGE were classified as ‘normal’. Compared to controls, ‘normal’ HCM segments had increased MD (1.61 ± 0.09 vs. 1.46 ± 0.07 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.02), increased E2A (60 ± 9° vs. 38 ± 12°, P \&lt; 0.001), and decreased FA (0.29 ± 0.04 vs. 0.35 ± 0.02, P = 0.002). Across all HCM segments, subendocardial regions had higher MD and lower MPR than subepicardial (MDendo 1.61 ± 0.08 × 10−3 mm2/s vs. MDepi 1.56 ± 0.18 × 10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.003, MPRendo 1.85 ± 0.83, MPRepi 2.28 ± 0.87, P \&lt; 0.0001).
            
            
              Conclusion
              In HCM patients, even in segments with normal wall thickness, normal perfusion, and no scar, diffusion is more isotropic than in controls, suggesting the presence of underlying cardiomyocyte disarray. Increased E2A suggests the myocardial sheetlets adopt hypercontracted angulation in systole. Increased MD, most notably in the subendocardium, is suggestive of regional remodelling which may explain the reduced subendocardial blood flow.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In this work we present a dual-phase diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique that incorporates a correction scheme for the cardiac material strain, based on 3D myocardial tagging.
Methods: In vivo dual-phase cardiac DTI with a stimulated echo approach and 3D tagging was performed in 10 healthy volunteers. The time course of material strain was estimated from the tagging data and used to correct for strain effects in the diffusion weighted acquisition. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, helix, transverse and sheet angles were calculated and compared between systole and diastole, with and without strain correction. Data acquired at the systolic sweet spot, where the effects of strain are eliminated, served as a reference.
Results: The impact of strain correction on helix angle was small. However, large differences were observed in the transverse and sheet angle values, with and without strain correction. The standard deviation of systolic transverse angles was significantly reduced from 35.963.9u to 27.8u63.5u (p,0.001) upon strain-correction indicating more coherent fiber tracks after correction. Myocyte aggregate structure was aligned more longitudinally in systole compared to diastole as reflected by an increased transmural range of helix angles (71.8u63.9u systole vs. 55.6u65.6u, p,0.001 diastole). While diastolic sheet angle histograms had dominant counts at high sheet angle values, systolic histograms showed lower sheet angle values indicating a reorientation of myocyte sheets during contraction.
Conclusion: An approach for dual-phase cardiac DTI with correction for material strain has been successfully implemented. This technique allows assessing dynamic changes in myofiber architecture between systole and diastole, and emphasizes the need for strain correction when sheet architecture in the heart is imaged with a stimulated echo approach.},
